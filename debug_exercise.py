# Exercise 2 Wrong output. Try to find and fix the bug(s)

  return number // divisor

print(calculate_divide(10, 2)) # Expected 5
print(calculate_divide(10, 3)) # Expected 3.33

# Exercise 3: Read the error output and fix the bug
def greet_user(name):

# Exercise 4: This program converts a username to an email address, but it's buggy. Try to find and fix the bug(s).

# Remove special characters and space from the username
